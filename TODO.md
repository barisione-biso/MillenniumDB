- Catalog:
    - number of node and edges.
    - number of different keys.
    - count for each label_id for node/edge (separated).
    - count for each key for node/edge (separated). Stop if having more than X different keys.
- When creating nodes/edges, accept strings as ID and save it in a new BPT.
- When importing the graph, all nodes needs an id.
- Creating edges don't accept custom ID.
- Parse JSON (if can be efficent, else Property Graph Exchange Format) and create nodes/edges
- Revisar generador de grafos que envi√≥ Renzo.
- Initialize BPlusTreeParams correctly:
    - calculate max_records for dir and leaf.
    - detect if exists.
- Inserting duplicated values in BPT should throw exception.
- Return nullptr if bpt.get() don't found the key.
- if bpt.edit() don't found the key throw exception.
